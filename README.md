The name is Moh.

Moh has a super power, Moh is considered a magician by many, they seem to think he speaks to computers and make them do his bidding. Moh is happy, he spent years mastering his ```magical skills``` and will still spend years getting better.

The few who possess the same power know Moh is just an ordinary guy with a computer. 
Be like Moh.
