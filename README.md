# The name is Moh.

Moh has a superpower, Moh is considered a magician by many, they seem to think he speaks to computers and makes them do his bidding. Moh is happy, he has spent a lot of time mastering his magical skills and will spend years ahead getting better.

The few who possess the same power know Moh is just an ordinary guy with a computer. 

Be like Moh.
